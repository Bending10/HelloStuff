HelloStuff
This is simply supposed to be an easy file to clone over onto the desktop and then run it through GitBash. 
The problem that I've run into is that as I go in the c/users/mitch_000/documents/GitHub/ directory and look at the corresponding
files that i've cloned from here there are no python files or anything to run in gitbash.
